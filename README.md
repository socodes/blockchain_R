# Blockchain in R

A blockchain is a chain(list) of related blocks. 

### The structure of block:

A block consist of a list of transaction(in this program a string is used to simplify),
a hash of the previous block in the chain, and a certain nonce value 
which the miner should receive in such a way as to prove that the work spent
block mining has been completed.

Like Bitcoin, cryptographic algorithm SHA-256 is used for hash calculating.
R library "digest" is used to generate hashed SHA-256 version of a string.

## Dependencies:
- R version 4.0.5 or newer
- digest
- testthat

## Building:

- Install devtools by typing (within R)

```
- install.packages(devtools)
```

- Then load the devtools package with
```
- library(devtools)
```
- Then, to build the package, type
```
- build()
```
This will create the PACKAGE_NAME.tar.gz file.

## Testing:

Unit testing is used. Testing covers index of a block, data of a block and privous hash and current hash checking.

```
- Change current working directory to repository location.
- Run the script: "Rscript tests.R"
```

## Install:

To install the R package, youâ€™d type

```
- install()
OR
- R CMD INSTALL PACKAGE_NAME.tar.gz
```
## How to use:
- Install required R language version from https://www.r-project.org
- install required packages from command line as:
install.package(PACKAGE_NAME)
- Change current working directory to repository location.
- Run the script: "Rscript script.R"
