# Blockchain in R

A blockchain is a chain(list) of related blocks. 

### The structure of block:

A block consist of a list of transaction(in this program a string is used to simplify),
a hash of the previous block in the chain, and a certain nonce value 
which the miner should receive in such a way as to prove that the work spent
block mining has been completed.

Like Bitcoin, cryptographic algorithm SHA-256 is used for hash calculating.
R library "digest" is used to generate hashed SHA-256 version of a string.

Dependencies:
- R version 4.0.5 or newer
- digest
- testthat

Building:
- will be implemented.

Testing:

Unit testing is used. Testing covers index of a block, data of a block and privous hash and current hash checking.
